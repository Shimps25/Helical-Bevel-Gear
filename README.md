# ⚙️ Helical Bevel Gear — Fusion 360 CAD Model

This repository contains a detailed 3D model and animation of a **Helical Bevel Gear** designed in **Autodesk Fusion 360**. Helical bevel gears are used to transfer motion between intersecting shafts at an angle, typically 90°, while providing smoother and quieter operation compared to straight-cut bevel gears.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This model was created to explore the design and geometry of helical bevel gears for applications requiring **angular torque transmission** with **high efficiency and reduced noise**. The design is suitable for integration into gearboxes, differential systems, and robotic joints.

## 🧩 Key Features

- ⚙️ **Helical tooth profile** for smooth meshing
- 🌀 **Bevel geometry** for angled shaft engagement
- 🧰 **Precision-modeled tooth curvature** using Fusion 360’s sweep and loft tools
- 🖨️ **Export-ready STL file** for 3D printing or simulation
